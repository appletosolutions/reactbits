### Educational Threads

**Performance Thread**
🧵 Why most React animation libraries kill your performance (and how to fix it)

1/ The problem: Heavy bundles
Most animation libraries are 150-200KB+. That's before your actual app code.

2/ The solution: Smart architecture
ReactBits core is 50KB. Advanced features load on-demand.

3/ The difference: Real-world impact
50KB vs 200KB = 3x faster initial load on 3G networks.
